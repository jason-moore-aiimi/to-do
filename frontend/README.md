## Frontend

The frontend is written in vanilla javascript. This can be ran using the command `npm start`. This uses the npm package `http-server` to host the index.html file, this can be accessed by going to the address http://localhost:8080. 

When developing the application changes to the webpage are not automatically updated. To see the changes the page will need to be refreshed.
